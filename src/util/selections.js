    name: 'Gelato',
    description: "Gelato, Ice Cream's Italian cousin, is made with whole milk, without using added cream. This makes the milkfat percentage much lower than traditional ice cream. Also, gelato is often made without eggs and stabilizers. While it is being churned, there is little to no air whipped into it, leaving a dense, thick texture.",

    description: 'Frozen yogurt, or Fro-Yo, is a very popular form of ice cream right now. This frozen treat is made using some of the same ingredients as ice cream, but with a much lower percentage of fat. There is also yogurt mixed in, which gives it more of a tart taste.',

    name: 'Sorbet',
    description: "Sorbet is a fruit-forward frozen treat with no dairy whatsoever. In fact, sorbet traditionally consists of only two ingredients—fruit puree and sugar—that are then churned and frozen in the same manner as ice cream. The absence of dairy accounts for the rough and flaky texture of sorbet, as well as the fact that it's served not only as a dessert, but also as a palate cleanser between courses.",

    name: 'Sherbet',
    description: "Sherbet is a frozen treat made from fruit purée, plus a scant amount of dairy. Indeed, although sherbet is always made with some form of dairy, the resulting dessert is distinct from ice cream in that it contains only 1 to 2 percent milkfat, as compared to the 10 percent milkfat found in the latter. As such, sherbet is only slightly creamy and considerably lighter than good ol' fashioned ice cream.",

    name: 'Italian Ice',
    description: 'Derived from the Sicilian granita, this style of frozen dessert is dairy-free and has a lot in common with sorbet in terms of its ingredients and the way in which it is made. There is a slight difference in texture, however; Italian ice is, well, icier, while sorbet has a smoother mouthfeel.',

    name: 'Kulfi',
    description: 'This traditional Indian ice cream is made by slowly heating sweetened milk until the sugar caramelizes and the milk condenses; the mixture is then frozen in cone-shaped molds without first being whipped or churned.As a result, kulfi is denser and creamier than American ice cream, with a custard-like quality that lends itself well to being served on a stick.',

Mastic—an (edible) organic glue made from the resin of the mastic tree—is the secret ingredient responsible for the elastic, taffy-like consistency of dondurma.",

Here, the standard ingredients (milk, cream, sugar) are heated, aerated and rapidly cooled to produce Swiss roll-style ribbons of ice cream that can be served upright in a cup and finished with a wide variety of toppings.

    description: 'Frozen custard is a frozen dessert similar to ice cream, but made with eggs in addition to cream and sugar. It is made from milk, cream, and egg yolks. It is produced in a machine that barely incorporates air into it, which means it’s more dense than ice cream. It is typically served immediately from the machine at more of a soft-serve temperature, so it melts as soon as you take a bite.',
