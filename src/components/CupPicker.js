// HI SI 579 Student! This is not *that* complex an application,
// but turning it into written instructions sure makes it seem
// that way. For many of you, basing most of what you do on the
// working example will be easier than going through all these
// instructions across four components.

// @tip if we already provided markup, keep it there. It's there
// to help.

// @tip the React Developer Tools Chrome extension will make this WAY
// easier. The components in the inspector won't match the component names anymore
// (this is default React behavior, lecture 13 have a workaround). It should
// be pretty clear which component is which, though...

// This ðŸ‘‡ is an array of cupChoices that has already been imported for you
// This will be used to create the grid of available cups to purchase.
